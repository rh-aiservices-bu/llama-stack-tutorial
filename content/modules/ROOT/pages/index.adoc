Welcome to the Llama-stack tutorial.

The aim of this tutorial is to provide a resource for developers interested in learning and using Llama-stack.

Before we get started, what is Llama Stack?

Llama Stack is an open-source framework that makes it easier to build, run, and experiment with large language models on your own infrastructure. It provides a unified interface for interacting with different model providers (like Ollama or vllm), supports tools and agents for more complex workflows, and includes a CLI, Python SDK, and web-based Playground for hands-on development.

The tutorial is divided into four sections:
